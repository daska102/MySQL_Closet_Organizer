# MySQL_Closet_Organizer
Uses MySQL to create a closet inventory and organization tool. Final Project for Database Management, CS408.

***In order to run, you would need to connect to an existing MySQL database!***

To run:
install the following packages:

Pip install pandas
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pillow

  In order to run, you would need to connect to an existing MySQL database, and fill in the database, user, password, and host fields before running the program.     
  Program will not run if this is not done.

  Prior to running the program, run the console_closet.sql file to create tables and indices.
  In the command line, run 'python ClosetMain.py' from within its directory.
